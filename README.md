Module 3 Challenge

For this challenge, we were given two different tasks: PyBank and PyPoll 

PyBank is tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the company's financial records. Python script should analyze the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

Python script can be found in the "main.py" file. The file with text results is in the "analysis" folder in the "budget_analasis.txt" file. In the resources folder, you can find the data file that was given for this task.

2. PyPoll is tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Python script should analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
Winner: Diana DeGette

Python script can be found in the "main.py" file. The file with text results is in the "analysis" folder in the "budget_analasis.txt" file. In the resources folder, you can find the data file that was given for this task.

While working on this module, I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT and tutor sessions, which helped me build the code.
